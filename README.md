# 📦 PackageTracker

**PackageTracker** is a simple package tracking web app I built as part of my **UX/UI design portfolio** at **Eastern Washington University**. It's a project that combines **clean design, accessibility, and basic front-end development** into a working, user-friendly site.

## **💡 Why I Made This**
I wanted to create something **useful, clean, and easy to use** while improving my skills in **UI/UX design and front-end development**. I designed the layout in **Figma**, focusing on **simplicity and accessibility**, then built the site using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Right now, the app **lets users add and track shipments** (saved in local storage). In the future, I’d love to add **real-time tracking using APIs** from major carriers.

✅ **Dark Mode** – Looks good in both light and dark themes  
✅ **Search & Filters** – Quickly find packages by status or date  
✅ **Simple & Clean UI** – Designed with accessibility in mind
